Flurry iOS Adapter for MoPub
============================

Adapter version 7.5.1 - Updated 2016-03-03
------------------------------------------

This version of the adapter works with MoPub iOS SDK 4+. If using older versions of the MoPub SDK, please refer to
[version 7.2.0](https://github.com/flurry/FlurryAdapterForMoPubiOS/tree/v7.2.0_for_mopub_pre_4.0.0) of the adapter.


###  Mediate Flurry Ads through MoPub

To integrate Flurry as the Custom Native Network in the MoPub ad serving flow, you need the
Custom Event Class code incorporated into your application, in addition to the Flurry SDK.
Three quick steps are necessary:

1. Integrate the Flurry SDK and Flurry adapter for MoPub code into your app
2. Configure Flurry's Ad space(s)
3. Configure MoPub to mediate Flurry

#### Integrate the Flurry SDK and Flurry adapter for MoPub code into your app

1. If your application is not yet using Flurry analytics, create a new application on Flurry's
dev portal. After logging into https://dev.flurry.com , select the Applications tab and from the
top righthand corner select Add New Application. In case your application is already tracked
by Flurry, you can download the latest SDK from the adjacent top righthand
link.

2. [Add the Flurry SDK](https://developer.yahoo.com/flurry/docs/publisher/code/ios/#integrate-the-sdk-with-your-app) to 
your Xcode project.

3. From the Flurry dashboard, record the API key for your iOS project. This will identify your app in the Flurry system.

4. Add the Flurry adapter classes for MoPub to your project.

5. Follow the [MoPub Custom Event integration steps](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-ios-sdk/wiki/Integrating-Third-Party-Ad-Networks)
for integrating banner and interstitial ads.

   The necessary files for banner and interstitial mediation should have already been added in step 3. These files are:
    * FlurryBannerCustomEvent.(h|m)
    * FlurryInterstitialCustomEvent.(h|m)

6. The steps to integrate Flurry Native Ads via MoPub are similar to those described [here](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-ios-sdk/wiki/Integrating-Native-Third-Party-Ad-Networks):

   For Flurry, the necessary for native mediation files are:
    * FlurryNativeCustomEvent.(h|m)
    * FlurryNativeAdAdapter.(h|m)

#### Configure Flurry Ad space(s)

For each MoPub ad unit that you would like to mediate Flurry through, please create a matching ad
space on Flurry's dev portal ( http://dev.flurry.com ). Log into the developer portal and navigate
to the **Publishers** tab. On the lefthand navigation bar select **Inventory** and then
**Ad Spaces**.

With **Ad Spaces** selected youâ€™ll see an index of previously created ad spaces. To set up a new one,
Click on the **New Ad Space** button on the top right. The Ad Space setup screen has four modules.

The Basic Setup section includes fields required to define the name, application, dimensions,
placement and orientation of the ad space.

The basic setup is all you need for most integrations and you can click the "Save Ad Space" button.

Please note that mediating Flurry through MoPub requires no additional Flurry-related code.
The Flurry Advertising code is already incorporated in this adapter's code.

#### Configure MoPub to mediate Flurry

Flurry's custom events are implemented in accordance with [instructions provided by MoPub](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-ios-sdk/wiki/Custom-Events).

After you incorporate the Flurry files into your project, you need to configure Flurry as a Custom Network. 
Please follow instructions provided by MoPub 
(for [banner, interstitial](https://dev.twitter.com/mopub/ui-setup/custom-network-setup) or [native](https://dev.twitter.com/mopub/ui-setup/network-setup-custom-native)) 
with any of the Flurry custom events class noted below:

* [`FlurryBannerCustomEvent`](FlurryBannerCustomEvent.h) for banner ads
* [`FlurryInterstitialCustomEvent`](FlurryInterstitialCustomEvent.h) for interstitial ads
* [`FlurryNativeCustomEvent`](FlurryNativeCustomEvent.h) for Flurry native ads

**NOTE:** An important step to get this integration working is to configure the custom network (as described above) with the
Flurry API key and Flurry Ad Space and send them as server extras (in the "Custom Event Class Data" field on the MoPub UI).

The custom event class data should be in the following JSON format:

```json
{"apiKey":"YOUR_API_KEY","adSpaceName":"AdSpaceName"}
```

You can also configure the custom event data as a line item in your MoPub order.
